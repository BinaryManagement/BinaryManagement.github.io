Managing a software project or product isn't always easy. First you have to deal with these odd folks that use words like API, CI/CD, technical debt, repositories, or stack. Once you manage to convey a simple feature request - using vigorous gestures and repeating yourself over and over and over ... - they start grilling you about all the finer points of what you meant. What do you know about it anyway? All you asked for was a simple shopping system right? Who cares about all these details that have to do with keeping records of price or product changes. Or not having a user system to tie these orders to...

Well, you've come to the right place my friend, as I'm about to tell you - and you should've seen this coming already - they're right. Sure, it's not easy to understand everything they say, but that's what we're here to help you with.

#### Why should I care about how software is made?
So this is the part you probably don't know if you have to ask this question. If you manage teams responsible for financial or medical software then you should already know why, but it doesn't hurt to keep reading.

Do you care about any of the following topics?
* On-time delivery
* Staying within the budget
* Lower cost (to maintain)
* Fewer bugs
* Limited chance to human error
* Adding value to your product
* Happy teams
* Getting results fast
* ...

As any self-respecting manager you want all of the above - unless you don't like people, you may have said NO to happy teams - and probably much more. After all, all of these things make for happier customers.

#### I still don't get why I should care about software development
Ok, I get it. You've been a manager for a long time and you've found a way to deal with software development even if you don't understand how it's made. By now you've probably just added 25% to every estimate the team comes up with, or you just _cut through the bullshit the team comes up with_ and only make them build what you say needs to be built - no sense in putting in that extensive user account system when you want a shopping system right?

But every time it feels like a fight when you want something done, or they - the team - grumble behind your back. When something doesn't work out the way it should they keep saying 'I told you so'. If hell breaks loose it takes a long time to get back up and running, yet no one in the team can pinpoint the root cause - or they can, and we're back to 'I told you so'.

Now, I'm not saying that by caring about - and understanding! - your software development process all these problems are magically solved, but it will help you get there faster and easier.

#### But they don't care about management
Yep. Most developers see managers as a nuisance and that's putting it mildly. I'm not saying it's justified, it's just what it is. But the only one capable of changing that is - drumroll - you.

Mostly the team is affraid of being micro managed, or to be treated as code monkeys that don't know what they're doing. If you have some bad habits that cause some of the problems described earlier, then changing them will already change this perception about management. 

#### Ok, I admit I want to know more
Good! Tell your team that as well. There's no shame in admitting you don't understand software development. Software development is complex, software systems are complex, there actually _is_ a difference between a front-end developer and a back-end developer.

So here's my first advice to caring about software development: **Ask questions!**

Please don't go overboard and ask what every single line of code means, but try to understand the technology used, or the importance of certain architectural choices. Try to see how their views map onto business or product goals. All of these guys love to show their work and explain why it's the greatest thing since sliced bread. Make use of that. Sure, they'll laugh a bit about your lack of knowledge, joke about trying to understand things they take for granted, but in the end they'll respect you for it.

Once you understand why some of these things really matter, you'll want them, because in the end it's better for the bottom line.

#### Nice story. Why should I take _your_ advice?
We are not all-knowing. Maybe there are things we say that don't work for you. We may be _wrong_. We do have over 20 years of experience between the two of us. We both started out as developers, but now have management positions in software. So we have seen a fair share of ups and downs, learned a lot over the years and we're willing to share our stories to help you learn a thing or two.

I've had my own company for nearly 11 years where we focused on web application development for small and midsize companies. At the same time I've also been partner in another company where we developed parental control software as well as corporate software for managing IT policies. Nowadays I work at Philips Research as a Senior Architect, where I am a Product Owner for a software capability team supporting over 30 software based innovations a year.

My friend Ryan... RYAN PLEASE WRITE YOUR BACKSTORY HERE...


I hope that this has piqued your interest. Next time we'll actually dig into a more specific software topic, but for now: _start asking questions_.
